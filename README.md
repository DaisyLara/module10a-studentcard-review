# Module 10A – StudentCard Code Review

## Description
This is a React code review assignment. I reviewed the StudentCard component and added comments to 
explain the logic behind props, state, and interactivity.

## What I Learned
- Props are fairly easy to understand, and just seem to need to be referenced appropriately in the child component. State makes sense and is fairly easy to understand when reviewing code, but is hard to break down and write without a reference. I also learned React/inline CSS does not play nice with the typical //comments.
